<h1>Interest in IT <h1>
  <body>My interest in IT started back in primary school when I got my hands on my first DS. I started gaming when I was at a young age and only used and experienced more gaming consoles to the present day. My interest in IT today is very broad, I like video gaming with friends, learning about automation. I have an interest in setting up home networks and running cables as I learnt this during my apprenticeship. I enjoy watching various you tubers talk about technology. I have an interest in Tesla and Elon Musk and the technology side of car automation and renewable energy. Elon Musk through watching and listening to various podcasts with him in including the Joe Rogan podcast found myself fascinated in renewable energy and automation of vehicles. Besides Musk no one else has really sparked my interest for IT, my cousin was big into gaming so possibly introducing me into that at a young age has helped my passion for IT.
I chose to come to IT because i have a passion for helping others and want to get a greater understanding and knowledge into IT so I can hopefully one day start my own business and teach the fundamentals and basics that I have learnt to another person to make their life easier with technology. 
From my studies I expect to learn a vast and variance overview of technology as a whole. I’m doing this course to gain a variety of skills that I can use in the real world. I am doing this course to have my knowledge within the IT field so that once I complete the course I can start my own business. <body>
